I am a Javascript developer working on few interesting things. I co-founded two startups and saw them crushed into the ground because of small mistakes I made. I am also an INTP (MBTI Personality type) with little attention deficiency, so classrooms are the only places where I didn’t learn anything.

One of my life goal is to try to find generalised solutions for the complex problems I find and make them as reproducible as possible. I love startups and everything about them and few technologies/markets I’m insanely interested in are open source, cloud APIs,enterprise software,bitcoin,data science,virtual reality,sharing economy,independent science research and education disruption.

People whose opinion I very highly value: Ben Horowitz, Paypal Mafia, Paul Graham and Evan Williams.

Other interests include Chelsea FC, dark humour (standup, sketch and cartoon),EDM,Indie rock, Death Note,Naruto,social psychology,minimalism,NPR and Sherlock(BBC).</p>
